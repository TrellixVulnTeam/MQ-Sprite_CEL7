## Synopsis

The MoonQuest Sprite Editor is a tool for managing and editing game sprites. It was built during the development of [MoonQuest](https://www.playmoonquest.com) and has been recently updated with a cleaner UI, new features, and supporting scripts. 
The editor is most suitable for games that use low resolution pixel art (in the order of 50x50 pixels in dimensions). It features:

* A listing of all the sprites in the project with icon previews;
* Folders for organising sprites into groups;
* Basic pixel art tools (pencil, eraser, colour pick, flood fill, copy-paste, undo-redo);
* An animation editor, that supports multiple animations per sprite;
* Anchors and pivots for defining attachment points in a sprite (such as a sword handle);
* Drop-shadow and onion-skinning;
* A simple save format (A single JSON file + PNG images for all frames);
* Bundled Python scripts for manipulating the save files in your toolchain; and
* A general properties window for adding arbitrary meta-data (in JSON format);
