## Synopsis

(https://github.com/eigenbom/moonquest-sprite-editor/raw/origin/master/icons/application_icon_64.png "MQ Sprite Icon")

MQ Sprite is a tool for editing and managing game sprites.

It was built during the development of [MoonQuest](https://www.playmoonquest.com) and has been recently updated with a cleaner UI, new features, and supporting scripts. The editor has been designed for games that use low resolution pixel art. It features:

* A listing of all the sprites in the project with icon previews;
* Folders for organising sprites into groups;
* Basic pixel art tools (pencil, eraser, colour pick, flood fill, copy-paste, undo-redo);
* An animation editor, that supports multiple animations per sprite;
* Anchors and pivots for defining attachment points in a sprite (such as a sword handle);
* Drop-shadow and onion-skinning;
* A simple save format (A single JSON file + PNG images for all frames);
* Bundled Python scripts for manipulating the save files in your toolchain; and
* A general properties window for adding arbitrary meta-data (in JSON format);

## Download

For other platforms you will have to build it yourself. It required Qt5 and can be built directly from within QtCreator.
